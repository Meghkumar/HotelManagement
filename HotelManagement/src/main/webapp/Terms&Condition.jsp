              <li>
                As a general rule, the hotel waits for contact from the owner regarding instructions
                on what to do with lost or found items. If the owner fails to provide instructions
                or if the owner is unknown, valuables and items containing personal information will
                be delivered to the nearest police station within seven (7) days of the date of
                discovery, while other items will be disposed of three (3) months from the date of
                discovery. Please be aware the food, drink, cigarettes, magazines, and other items
                detrimental to sanitation will be disposed of on the same day.

                every fourth night to maintain sanitary conditions. However, the hotel retains the
                right to clean guestrooms at any time if it is deemed necessary. Guestrooms may also
                be entered on days other than cleaning days for maintenance, legal inspections, and
                emergencies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Should a guest’s behavior warrant protection of the rights, property, or services of
                the hotel or another guest, the hotel will notify the police and other relevant
                authorities or otherwise take appropriate measures.
